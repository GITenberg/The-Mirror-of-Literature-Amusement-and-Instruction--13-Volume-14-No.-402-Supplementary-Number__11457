  <h3>The Landscape Annual.</h3>

  <center>
    LONDON AND PARIS, 1830.
  </center>
  <hr />

  <p>MAGNIFIQUE! SUPERBE! will be the exclamation of the Parisians
  on beholding the Plates of this Work, at the Publishers, in the
  Gallerie Vivienne, and equally enthusiastic will be the
  admiration of all Londoners whilst inspecting them in Cheapside.
  The <i>second</i> title, "The Tourist in Italy and Switzerland,"
  implies the contents of the volume far better than the first.
  There are twenty-five Plates, each nearly as large as one of our
  pages, by various engravers, and all from drawings, by Mr. Prout.
  The subjects are as follow:&mdash;Geneva, Lausanne, Chillon,
  Bridge of St. Maurice, Lavey, Martigny, Sion, Visp, Domo
  d'Ossola, Castle of Anghiera, Milan Cathedral, Lake of Como,
  Como, Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Petrarch's House at Arqua, the
  Rialto at Venice, Ducal Palace at ditto, Palace of the Two
  Foscari, ditto; Bridge of Sighs, ditto; Old Ducal Palace at
  Ferrara, Bologna, Ponte Sisto, Rome, Fish Market, Ruins, ditto,
  and a Vignette of Constantine's Arch.</p>

  <p>The Descriptions are from the elegant pen of Thomas Roscoe,
  Esq. By permission, of the proprietor we have selected one of the
  plates, and a portion of its accompanying description.</p>

  <center>
    BOLOGNA,
  </center>

  <p>"Celebrated alike in arts and in letters, Bologna, 'the mother
  of studies,' presents numerous objects of interest to the amateur
  and to the scholar. The halls which were trod by Lanfranc and
  Irnerius, and the ceilings which glow with the colours of Guido
  and the Carracci, can never be neglected by any to whom learning
  and taste are dear.</p>

  <p>"The external appearance of Bologna is singular and striking.
  The principal streets display lofty arcades, and the churches,
  which are very numerous, confer upon the city a highly
  architectural character. But the most remarkable edifices in
  Bologna are the watch-towers, represented in the engraving.
  During the twelfth century, when the cities of Italy, 'tutte
  piene di tirranni,' were rivals in arms as afterwards in arts,
  watch-towers of considerable elevation were frequently erected.
  In Venice, in Pisa, in Cremona, in Modena, and in Florence these
  singular structures yet remain; but none are more remarkable than
  the towers of the Asinelli and Garisenda in Bologna. The former,
  according to one chronicler, was built in 1109, while other
  authorities assign it to the year 1119. The Garisenda tower,
  constructed a few years later, has been immortalized in the verse
  of Dante.</p>

  <p>"When the poet and his guide are snatched up by the huge
  Antaeus, the bard compares the stooping stature of the giant to
  the tower of the Garisenda, which, as the spectator stands at its
  base while the clouds are sailing from the quarter to which it
  inclines, appears to be falling upon his head,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"'As appears</p>

      <p>The tower of Cariaenda from beneath</p>

      <p>Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud</p>

      <p>So sail across that opposite it hangs;</p>

      <p>Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease</p>

      <p>I mark'd him stooping.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"The tower of the Asinelli rises the height of about 350 feet,
  and is said to be three feet and a half out of the perpendicular.
  The adventurous traveller may ascend to the top by a laborious
  staircase of 500 steps. Those steps were trod by the late amiable
  and excellent Sir James Edward Smith, who has described the view
  presented at the summit. 'The day was unfavourable for a view;
  but we could well distinguish Imola, Ferrara and Modena, as well
  as the hills about Verona, Mount Baldus, &amp;c., seeming to rise
  abruptly from the dead flat which extends on three sides of
  Bologna. On the south are some very pleasant hills stuck with
  villas.' The Garisenda tower, erected probably by the family of
  the Garidendi, is about 130 feet in height, and inclines as much
  as eight feet from the perpendicular. It has been conjectured
  that these towers were originally constructed as they now appear;
  but it is difficult to give credit to such a supposition.</p>

  <p>"According to Montfaucon, the celebrated antiquary, the
  leaning of these towers has been occasioned by the sinking of the
  earth. 'We several times observed the tower called Asinelli, and
  the other near it, named Garisenda. The latter of them stoops so
  much that a perpendicular, let fall from the top, will be seven
  feet from the bottom of it; and, as appears upon examination,
  when this tower bowed, a great part of it went to ruin, because
  the ground that side that inclined stood on was not so firm as
  the other, which may be said of all other towers that lean so;
  for besides these two here mentioned, the tower for the bells of
  St. Mary Zobenica, at Venice, leans considerably to one side. So
  also at Ravenna, I took notice of another stooping tower
  occasioned by the ground on that side giving way a little. In the
  way from Ferrara to Venice, where the soil is marshy,
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371"></a>[pg
  371]</span> we see a structure of great antiquity leaning to one
  side. We might easily produce other instances of this nature.
  When the whole structure of the Garisenda stooped, much of it
  fell, as appears by the top of it.</p>

  <p>"Bologna, like most of the cities of Italy, has been the seat
  of many tragical incidents, affording such rich materials for her
  novelists. Amongst others, is one which we give in the words of
  the excellent critic by whom it is related. 'The family Geremie
  of Bologna were at the head of the Guelphs, and that of the
  Lambertazzi of the Ghibbelines, who formed an opposition by no
  means despicable to the domineering party. Bonifazio Geremei and
  Imelda Lambertazzi, forgetting the feuds of their families, fell
  passionately in love with each other, and Imelda received her
  lover into her house. This coming to her brothers' knowledge,
  they rushed into the room where the two lovers were, and Imelda
  could scarcely escape, whilst one of the brothers plunged a
  dagger, poisoned after the Saracen fashion, into Bonifazio's
  breast, whose body was thrown into some concealed part of the
  house and covered with rubbish. Imelda hastened to him, following
  the tracks of his blood, as soon as the brothers were gone; found
  him, and supposing him not quite dead, generously, as our own
  Queen Eleanor had done about the same time, sucked the poison
  from the bleeding wound, the only remedy which could possibly
  save his life; but it was too late: Imelda's attendants found her
  a corpse, embracing that of her beloved Bonifazio.'"</p>

  <p>The success of the Landscape Annual is very far from
  problematical. All our <i>travelled</i> nobility and people of
  fortune will buy it to refresh their acquaintance with the
  beautiful scenes it includes; and it is hardly possible to
  imagine a more agreeable book-companion on the journey
  itself.</p>

  <h2>LITERARY SOUVENIR.</h2>

  <p>(<i>Concluded from Supplement, page 336</i>.)</p>

  <p>The <i>poetry</i> of the <i>Souvenir</i> is, as usual, for the
  most part excellent. Among the best pieces are The Dying Mother
  to her Infant, by Caroline Bowles; Bring back the chain, by the
  authoress of the "Sorrows of Rosalie;" and The Birth-day, by N.P.
  Willis, a popular American writer. There are likewise some very
  graceful and touching pieces by Mr. Watts, the editor, one of
  which will be found in our next number. There are too some
  pleasant attempts at humorous relief; but "Vanity Fair" is a very
  poor attempt at jingling rhyme. We quote one of these light
  pieces for the sake of adding variety to our sheet:</p>

  <h3>WHERE IS MISS MYRTLE?</h3>

  <center>
    AIR&mdash;<i>Sweet Kitty Clover.</i>
  </center>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Where is Miss Myrtle? can any one tell?</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>She flirts with another, I know very well;</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>

      <p>She flies to the window when Arundel rings:</p>

      <p>She's all over smiles when Lord Archibald sings;</p>

      <p>It's plain that her Cupid has two pair of wings;</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>Her love and my love are different things:</p>

      <p>And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I brought her, one morning, a rose for her brow</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>She told me such horrors were never worn now:</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>

      <p>But I saw her at night with a rose in her hair,</p>

      <p>And I guess who it came from,&mdash;of course I don't
      care!</p>

      <p>We all know that girls are as false us they're fair;</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>I'm sure the lieutenant's a horrible bear;</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Whenever we go on the Downs for a ride,</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>She looks for another to trot by her side:</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>

      <p>And whenever I take her down stairs from a ball,</p>

      <p>She nods to some puppy to put on her shawl:</p>

      <p>I'm a peaceable man, and I don't like a brawl:</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>But I would give a trifle to horsewhip them all:</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>She tells me her mother belongs to the sect,</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>Which holds that all waltzing is quite incorrect:</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>

      <p>But a fire's in my heart and a fire's in my brain,</p>

      <p>When she waltzes away with Sir Phelim O'Shane;</p>

      <p>I don't think I ever <i>can</i> ask her again:</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>And, lord! since the summer she's grown very plain,</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>She said that she liked me a twelvemonth ago!</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>And how should I guess that she'd torture me so!</p>

      <p class="i2">And I&mdash;am left all alone!</p>

      <p>Some day she'll find out it was not very wise</p>

      <p>To laugh at the breath of a true lover's sighs:</p>

      <p>After all, Fanny Myrtle is not such a prize;</p>

      <p class="i2">Where is she gone, where is she gone?</p>

      <p>Louisa Dalrymple has exquisite eyes:</p>

      <p class="i2">And I'll be&mdash;no longer alone!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. Praed has an exquisite poem, "Memory;" and we had nearly
  passed by a song by Mr. T. Moore.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Alone beneath the moon I roved,</p>

      <p class="i2">And thought how oft in hours gone by,</p>

      <p>I heard my Mary say she loved</p>

      <p class="i2">To look upon a moonlight sky!</p>

      <p>The day had been one lengthened shower,</p>

      <p class="i2">Till moonlight came, with lustre meek,</p>

      <p>To light up every weeping flower,</p>

      <p class="i2">Like smiles upon a mourner's cheek.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I called to mind from Eastern books</p>

      <p class="i2">A thought that could not leave me
      soon:&mdash;</p>

      <p>"The moon on many a night-flower looks,</p>

      <p class="i2">The night-flower sees no other moon."</p>

      <p>And thus I thought our fortune's run,</p>

      <p class="i2">For many a lover sighs to thee;</p>

      <p>While oh! I feel there is but <i>one</i>,</p>

      <p class="i2"><i>One</i> Mary in the world for me!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>[pg
  372]</span> The illustrations are almost unexceptionably good;
  the <i>gems</i> in this way being Mrs. Siddons, as Lady Macbeth,
  by C. Rolls, after Harlowe: the face is perhaps the most
  intellectual piece of engraving ever seen; the sublime effect in
  so small a space is truly surprising. A Portrait, by W. Danforth,
  after Leslie, ranks next; and the beauty and variety of the
  remainder of the prints are so great as to prevent our
  <i>individualizing</i> them to the reader. Taken altogether, they
  form one of the finest Annual Galleries or Collections.</p>
  <hr class="full" />

  <h2>THE KEEPSAKE.</h2>
  <hr />

  <p>Without going into a dreamy discussion on the
  <i>literature</i> of this work, we venture to say it has rather
  retrograded from, than improved upon the volume of last year.
  Great and titled names only furnish the <i>gilt:</i> and this
  fact is now so generally understood, that readers are no longer
  deceived by them, in the quality of the gingerbread. Mr. Watts is
  so convinced of this fact, that he has given the cut direct to
  many titled authors; and, for aught we know, he has produced as
  good a volume this year as on any former occasion. The proprietor
  of the <i>Keepsake</i> appears to think otherwise; and his editor
  has accordingly produced a book of very meagre interest, though
  of mightier pretensions than his rivals. Months ago we were told
  by announcement, paragraph and advertisement, of a tragedy,
  <i>The House of Aspen</i>, by Sir Walter Scott, which now turns
  out to be as dull an affair as any known in these days of
  dramatic poverty and theatrical ups and downs. Sir Walter, in an
  advertisement of great modesty, dated April 1, says, that "being
  of too small a size of consequence for a separate publication,
  the piece is sent as a contribution to the <i>Keepsake</i>, where
  its demerits may be hidden amid the beauties of more valuable
  articles." The piece has been adapted to a minor stage with some
  effect, but nothing higher than a melodrama. We have neither room
  nor inclination to extract a scene, but one of the metrical
  pieces has tempted us:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Sweet shone the sun on the fair Lake of Toro,</p>

      <p class="i2">Weak were the whispers that waved the dark
      wood,</p>

      <p>As a fair maiden bewilder'd in sorrow,</p>

      <p class="i2">Sigh'd to the breezes and wept to the
      flood.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Saints from the mansion of bliss lowly bending,</p>

      <p class="i2">Virgin, that hear'st the poor suppliant's
      cry,</p>

      <p>Grant my petition, in anguish ascending.</p>

      <p class="i2">My Frederick restore, or let Eleanor die."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Distant and faint were the sounds of the battle,</p>

      <p class="i2">With the breezes they rise, with the breezes
      they fail,</p>

      <p>Till the shout, and the groan, and the conflict's dread
      rattle,</p>

      <p class="i2">And the chase's wild clamour came loading the
      gale.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Breathless she gaz'd through the woodland so dreary,</p>

      <p class="i2">Slowly approaching, a warrior was seen;</p>

      <p>Life's ebbing tide mark'd his footstep so weary,</p>

      <p class="i2">Cleft was his helmet, and woe was his mien.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Save thee, fair maid, for our armies are flying;</p>

      <p class="i2">Save thee, fair maid, for thy guardian is
      low;</p>

      <p>Cold on yon heath thy bold Frederick is lying,</p>

      <p class="i2">Fast through the woodland approaches the
      foe."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Two of the best stories are The Bride, by Theodore Hook, and
  the Shooting Star, an Irish tale, by Lord Nugent; and a Dialogue
  for the year 2310, by the author of Granby, has considerable
  smartness. The scene is in London, where one of the speakers has
  just arrived "from out of Scotland; breakfasted this morning at
  Edinburgh, and have not been in town above a couple of hours. The
  roads are dreadfully heavy now: conceive my having been seven
  hours and a half coming from Edinburgh to London." Killing
  between four and five thousand head of game in one day is
  shooting ill; and one of the party has a gun which would give
  twenty-seven discharges in a minute, and mine would give only
  twenty-five. I really must change my maker. Have you seen the
  last new invention, the hydro-potassian lock?" Hunting machines,
  that would fly like balloons over a ten-foot wall&mdash;A
  candidate for the Circumnavigation Club, who has been four times
  round the world in his own, yacht&mdash;A point of bad taste to
  make a morning call by daylight&mdash;Dining at twelve
  P.M.&mdash;A spring-door with a self-acting knocker, which gives
  a treble knock, and is opened by a steam porter in livery&mdash;A
  chair mounting from the hall, through the ceiling, into the
  drawing room&mdash;Talking to a lady two miles off through a
  telescope, till one's fingers ache&mdash;A callisthenic academy
  for the children of pauper operatives&mdash;An automaton
  note-writer&mdash;A lady professing ignorance of Almack's, "a
  club where Swift and Johnson used to meet, but I don't profess to
  be an antiquarian"&mdash;"Love and Algebra," one of the common
  scientific novels thumbed by coal-heavers and orange-women, very
  well for the common people&mdash;Every thing is taught them now
  by means of scientific novels: such as "Geological Atoms, or the
  Adventures of a Dustman"&mdash;Doubted very much whether English
  wheat is fit for any thing but the brute <span class=

  creation&mdash;Dark times of the 19th century&mdash;Six-hourly
  and half-daily newspapers&mdash;"<i>apropos</i>, as the
  hackney-coachmen say"&mdash;Turkey, one of the southern provinces
  of Russia&mdash;His Majesty Jonathan III. of Washington&mdash;The
  Emperor of India&mdash;The Burmese Republic&mdash;English the
  language of three-fourths of Asia, nine-tenths of North America,
  half Africa, and all the insular states in the South
  Seas&mdash;and England, that little kingdom, with a population of
  not more than forty millions, has had the honour of colonizing
  half the globe; but "these countries are our colonies no longer."
  Such are a few of the wonders of 2130! In the Dialogue is an
  admirable joke with a scientific street-sweeper and a learned
  beggar, who pleads <i>necessitas non habet legem</i>, and
  "embraces the profession of an operative mendicant." But here is
  a <i>morceau</i>:</p>

  <p><i>Lady D.</i>&mdash;Ah! Lord A.! Mr. C.! most unexpected
  persons both! I heard only yesterday that one of you was in
  Greenland, and the other in Africa. What false reports they
  circulate!</p>

  <p><i>Lord A.</i>&mdash;The reports were true not long ago, and I
  believe we returned about the same time. You, Lady D., have been
  also travelling, I believe.</p>

  <p><i>Lady D.</i>&mdash;Yes, we were out of England in the
  winter. Our physician commanded a warmer climate for Lord D. so
  we took a villa on the Niger, and afterwards spent a short time
  at Sackatoo.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. C.</i>&mdash;I suppose you found it full of
  English?</p>

  <p><i>Lady D.</i>&mdash;Oh, quite full&mdash;and such a set! We
  knew hardly any of them. In fact, we did not go there for
  society. We met a few pleasant people, Australians; the
  Abershaws, the Hardy Vauxes, and Sir William and Lady Soames.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. C.</i>&mdash;Did you go by the new Tangier and
  Timbuctoo road?</p>

  <p><i>Lady D.</i>&mdash;Yes, we did, and we found it excellent.
  By the bye, Lord A., to digress to a different latitude, how did
  you succeed in your last excursion to the North Pole?</p>

  <p><i>Lord A.</i>&mdash;To tell you the truth, extremely ill; we
  had most improvidently taken with us scarcely enough of the
  <i>solvent</i> to work our way through the ice, and our
  concentrated essence of caloric was found to be of a very
  inferior quality. I shall try again next summer.</p>

  <p><i>Lady D.</i>&mdash;I believe we shall go to Spitzbergen
  ourselves.</p>

  <p><i>Lord A.</i>&mdash;I am happy to think that, in that case, I
  may perhaps have the pleasure of meeting you there on my return.
  I must go to the Pole, by the way of North Georgia: I am engaged
  to visit an Eskimaux friend.</p>

  <p>Still more ludicrous are the following historical
  blunders:&mdash;One of the party asks how Napoleon is introduced
  in an historical novel of 1830? The reply is&mdash;"He and the
  Emperor Alexander of Russia are introduced dining with the King
  at Brighton. Napoleon quarrels with the two sovereigns, and
  challenges them to a personal encounter. Each claims the right of
  fighting by deputy. The King of England appoints his prime
  minister, the Duke of Wellington; the Emperor Alexander appoints
  Prince Kutusoff. The Duke of Wellington is to go out first, and
  is to meet Napoleon at Battersea Fields. There were open fields
  at Battersea: <i>then</i>: only think! open fields! I don't know
  how the duel ends&mdash;I am just in the midst of it&mdash;it is
  so interesting."</p>

  <p>The author of <i>Anastasius</i> (Mr. Thos. Hope) has
  contributed five or six pages on Self-love, Sympathy, and
  Selfishness&mdash;which are deep enough for any Lady D. of this
  or the next century. We expected a powerful and picturesque tale
  of the East, and not such sententious matter as
  this:&mdash;"Every sentient entity, from the lowest of brutes to
  the highest of human beings, desires self-gratification:" we may
  add, a principle as well understood in Covent-garden as in
  Portland-place. Mr. Banim has written The Hall of the Castle, an
  interesting Irish story; and Lord Normanby, The Prophet of St.
  Paul's, of the date of 1514&mdash;which concludes the volume.</p>

  <p>Among the Poetry are some pretty verses by Lord Porchester;
  but it is well that metrical pieces do not predominate, for some
  of the writers are sadly unmusical sonneteers.</p>

  <p>The "Letters from Lord Byron to several Friends" are not of
  interest enough for the space they occupy.</p>

  <p>The <i>Plates</i> are beyond praise. The Frontispiece Portrait
  of Lady Georgiana Agar Ellis, by Charles Heath, is one of the
  most exquisite ever engraved; and two plates illustrating Sir
  Walter Scott's <i>House of Aspen</i> have the effect of beautiful
  pictures on a blank wall. <i>Two</i> views of Virginia Water are,
  perhaps, questionable in the same volume; but they are admirably
  engraved. Wilkie's "beautiful, though," as Lord Normanby says,
  "somewhat slight cabinet picture of the Princess Doria and the
  Pilgrims<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>" <span class="pagenum"><a id=
  "page374" name="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span> has been finely
  executed by Heath; and a View of Venice, from a drawing by Prout,
  is a masterpiece of Freebairne. Equal to either of these is The
  Faithful Servant, engraved by Goodyear, after Cooper, and
  Dorothea, the title-page plate. Of The Bride, engraved by Charles
  Heath, from a picture by Leslie, it is impossible to speak in
  terms of sufficient praise, as it is, without exception, one of
  the loveliest prints ever beheld. We have had our laugh at The
  Portrait, a scene from Foote, painted by Smirke, and engraved by
  Portbury. Its whim and humour is describable only by the British
  Aristophanes. We can only add, that it is Lady Pentweazle sitting
  to Carmine for her portrait&mdash;the look that he despairs of
  imitating, as we do Foote's account of her family:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"All my family, by the mother's side, are famous for their
  eyes. I have a great aunt amongst the beauties at Windsor; she
  has a sister at Hampton Court, a perdegeous fine woman! she had
  but one eye, but that was a piercer: that one eye got her three
  husbands."</p>

  <p>The painter appears to us to be a portrait of Foote. We ought
  not to forget to mention, at least, Francis I. and his Sister,
  splendidly engraved by C. Heath, from a picture by Bonington.</p>

  <h2>THE COMIC ANNUAL.</h2>

  <p><i>By Thomas Hood, Esq.</i></p>

  <p>We intend to let the facetious author have his own <i>say</i>
  on the comical contents of this very comical little work, by
  merely running over a few of the head and tail pieces of the
  several pages. We think with Mr. Hood, that "In the Christmas
  Holidays, or rather, Holly Days, according to one of the emblems
  of the season, we naturally look for mirth. Christmas is strictly
  a Comic Annual, and its specific gaiety is even implied in the
  specific gravity of its oxen." So much for the design, which is
  far more congenial to our feelings than the thousand and one
  sonnets, pointless epigrams, laments, and monodies, which are
  usually showered from crimson and gold envelopes at this dull
  season of the year. There are thirty-seven pieces&mdash;all in
  humorous and "righte merrie conceite." We shall give a few random
  extracts, or specimens, and then run over the cuts. Our first
  is&mdash;(and what should it be?)</p>

  <h3>THE FURLOUGH.&mdash;AN IRISH ANECDOTE.</h3>

  <p>"In the autumn of 1825, some private affairs called me into
  the sister kingdom; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name=
  "page375"></a>[pg 375]</span> and as I did not travel, like
  Polyphemus, with my eye out, I gathered a few samples of Irish
  character, amongst which was the following incident:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I was standing one morning at the window of 'mine Inn,' when
  my attention was attracted by a scene that took place beneath.
  The Belfast coach was standing at the door, and on the roof, in
  front, sat a solitary outside passenger, a fine young fellow, in
  the uniform of the Connaught Rangers. Below, by the front wheel,
  stood an old woman, seemingly his mother, a young man, and a
  younger woman, sister or sweetheart; and they were all earnestly
  entreating the young soldier to descend from his seat on the
  coach.</p>

  <p>"'Come down wid ye, Thady'&mdash;the speaker was the old
  woman&mdash;'come down now to your ould mother; sure it's flog ye
  they will, and strip the flesh off the bones I giv ye. Come down,
  Thady, darlin!'</p>

  <p>"'It's honour, mother,' was the short reply of the soldier;
  and with clenched hands and set teeth, he took a stiffer posture
  on the coach.</p>

  <p>"'Thady, come down&mdash;come down, ye fool of the
  world&mdash;come along down wid ye!' The tone of the present
  appeal was more impatient and peremptory than the last; and the
  answer was more promptly and sternly pronounced: 'It's honour,
  brother!' and the body of the speaker rose more rigidly erect
  than ever on the roof.</p>

  <p>"'O Thady, come down! sure it's me, your own Kathleen, that
  bids ye! Come down, or ye'll break the heart of me, Thady, jewel;
  come down then!' The poor girl wrung her hands as she said it,
  and cast a look upward that had a visible effect on the muscles
  of the soldier's countenance. There was more tenderness in his
  tone, but it conveyed the same resolution as before.</p>

  <p>"'It's honour, honour bright, Kathleen!' and, as if to defend
  himself from another glance, he fixed his look steadfastly in
  front, while the renewed entreaties burst from all three in
  chorus, with the same answer.</p>

  <p>"'Come down, Thady, honey!&mdash;Thady, ye fool, come
  down!&mdash;O Thady, come down to me!'</p>

  <p>"'It's honour, mother!&mdash;It's honour,
  brother!&mdash;Honour bright, my own Kathleen!'</p>

  <p>"Although the poor fellow was a private, this appeal was so
  public, that I did not hesitate to go down and inquire into the
  particulars of the distress. It appeared that he had been home,
  on furlough, to visit his family,&mdash;and having exceeded, as
  he thought, the term of his leave, he was going to rejoin his
  regiment, and to undergo the penalty of his neglect. I asked him
  when the furlough expired?</p>

  <p>"'The first of March, your honour&mdash;bad luck to it of all
  the black days in the world&mdash;and here it is, come sudden on
  me, like a shot!'</p>

  <p>"'The first of March!&mdash;why, my good fellow, you have a
  day to spare then&mdash;the first of March will not be here till
  to-morrow. It is Leap Year, and February has twenty-nine
  days.'</p>

  <p>"The soldier was thunder-struck.&mdash;'Twenty-nine days is
  it?&mdash;you're sartin of that same! Oh, mother,
  mother!&mdash;the devil fly away wid yere ould almanack&mdash;a
  base cratur of a book, to be deceaven one, afther living so long
  in the family of us!'</p>

  <p>"His first impulse was to cut a caper on the roof of the
  coach, and throw up his cap with a loud hurrah! His second was to
  throw himself into the arms of his Kathleen; and the third was to
  wring my hand off in acknowledgment.</p>

  <p>"'It's a happy man I am, your honour, for my word's saved, and
  all by your honour's manes. Long life to your honour for the
  same! May ye live a long hundred&mdash;and lape-years every one
  of them.'"</p>

  <p>"THOMAS FROST."</p>

  <p>We have lately paid much attention to the subject of
  Emigration, but quite in a different vein to the following, which
  will introduce one of the cuts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Squampash Flatts, 9th Nov. 1827.</p>

  <p>"Dear Brother&mdash;Here we are, thank Providence, safe and
  well, and in the finest country you ever saw. At this moment I
  have before me the sublime expanse of Squampash Flatts&mdash;the
  majestic Mudiboo winding through the midst&mdash;with the
  magnificent range of the Squab mountains in the distance. But the
  prospect is impossible to describe in a letter! I might as well
  attempt a panorama in a pill-box! We have fixed our settlement on
  the left bank of the river. In crossing the rapids we lost most
  of our heavy baggage, and all our iron work; but, by great good
  fortune, we saved Mrs. Paisley's grand piano, and the children's
  toys. Our infant city consists of three log-huts and one of clay,
  which, however, on the second day, fell in to the ground
  landlords. We have now built it up again, and, all things
  considered, are as comfortable as we could expect: and have
  christened our settlement New London, in compliment to the old
  metropolis. We have one of the log-houses to ourselves&mdash;or
  at least shall have, when we have built a new hog-sty. We burnt
  down the first one in making a bonfire to keep off the wild
  beasts, and, for the present, the pigs are in the parlour. As yet
  our rooms are rather usefully than elegantly furnished. We have
  gutted the Grand Upright, and it makes a convenient cupboard; the
  chairs were obliged to blaze at our bivouacs&mdash;but thank
  Heaven, we have never leisure to sit down, and so do not miss
  them. My boys are contented, and will be well when they have got
  over some awkward accidents in lopping and felling. Mrs. P.
  grumbles a little, but it is her custom to lament most when she
  is in the midst of comforts: she complains of solitude, and says
  she could enjoy the very stiffest of stiff visits. The first time
  we lighted a fire in our new abode, a large serpent came down the
  chimney, which I looked upon as a good omen. However, as Mrs. P.
  is not partial to snakes, and the heat is supposed to attract
  those reptiles, we have dispensed with fires ever since. As for
  wild beasts, we hear them howling and roaring round the fence
  every night from dusk till daylight; but we have only been
  inconvenienced by one lion. The first time he came, in order to
  get rid of the brute peaceably, we turned out an old ewe, with
  which he was well satisfied, but ever since he comes to us as
  regular as clock-work for his mutton; and if we do not soon
  contrive to cut his acquaintance, we shall hardly have a sheep in
  the flock. It would have been easy to shoot him, being well
  provided with muskets; but Barnaby mistook our remnant of
  gunpowder for onion seed, and sowed it all in the kitchen garden.
  We did try to trap him into a pit-fall; but after twice catching
  Mrs. P. and every one of the children in turn, it was given up.
  They are now, however, perfectly at ease about the animal, for
  they never stir out of doors at all; and, to make them quite
  comfortable, I have blocked up all the windows, and barricaded
  the door. We have lost only one of our number since we
  came&mdash;namely, Diggory, the market-gardener, from Glasgow,
  who went out one morning to botanize, and never came back. I am
  much surprised at his absconding, as he had nothing but a spade
  to go off with. Chippendale, the carpenter, was sent after him,
  but did not return; and Gregory, the smith, has been out after
  them these two days. I have just dispatched Mudge, the herdsman,
  to look for all three, and hope he will soon give a good account
  of them, as they are the most useful men in the whole settlement,
  and, in fact, indispensable to its existence. The river Mudiboo
  is deep and rapid, and said to swarm with alligators, though I
  have heard but of three being seen at one time, and none of those
  above eighteen feet long: this, however, is immaterial, as we do
  not use the river fluid, which is thick and dirty, but draw all
  our water from natural wells and tanks. Poisonous springs are
  rather common, but are easily distinguished by containing no fish
  or living animal. Those, however, which swarm with frogs, toads,
  newts, efts, &amp;c., are harmless, and may be safely used for
  culinary purposes. In short, I know of no drawback but one,
  which, I am sanguine, may be got over hereafter, and do earnestly
  hope and advise, if things are no better in England than when I
  left, you, and as many as you can persuade, will sell off all,
  and come over to this African Paradise. The drawback I speak of
  is this:&mdash;Although I have never seen any one of the
  creatures, it is too certain that the mountains are inhabited by
  a race of monkeys, whose cunning and mischievous talents exceed
  even the most incredible stories of their tribe. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>[pg 377]</span> No
  human art or vigilance seems of avail: we have planned
  ambuscades, and watched night after night, but no attempt has
  been made; yet the moment the guard was relaxed, we were stripped
  without mercy. I am convinced they must have had spies night and
  day on our motions&mdash;yet so secretly and cautiously, that no
  glimpse of one has yet been seen by any of our people. Our last
  crop was cut and carried off with the precision of an English
  harvesting. Our spirit stores&mdash;(you will be amazed to hear
  that these creatures pick locks with the dexterity of London
  burglars)&mdash;have been broken open and ransacked, though half
  the establishment were on the watch; and the brutes have been off
  to their mountains, five miles distant, without even the dogs
  giving an alarm. I could almost persuade myseif at times, such
  are their supernatural knowledge, swiftness, and invisibility,
  that we have to contend with evil spirits. I long for your
  advice, to refer to on this subject; and am, dear Philip,</p>

  <p>"Your loving brother,<br />
  "AMBROSE MAWE.</p>

  <p>"P.S. Since writing the above, you will be concerned to hear
  the body of poor Diggory has been found, horribly mangled by wild
  beasts. The fate of Chippendale, Gregory, and Mudge is no longer
  doubtful. The old lion has brought the lioness, and, the sheep
  being all gone, they have made a joint attack upon the
  bullock-house. The Mudiboo has overflowed, and Squampash Flatts
  are a swamp. I have just discovered that the monkeys are my own
  rascals, that I brought out from England. We are coming back as
  fast as we can."</p>

  <h3>EMMANUEL.</h3>

  <p>This little work is "decidedly of a religious character," and,
  to quote the preface, "its contents are in unison with the
  sanctity of its title." The editor is the Rev. W. Shepherd, the
  author of <i>Clouds and Sunshine;</i> and we quote an extract
  from one of his contributions: its gravities will blend with the
  gaieties of our sheet. The passage occurs in "Holy
  Associations:"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But there are other feelings besides those of mortality which
  are closely connected with a churchyard. Whilst from the ashes of
  the dead comes forth a voice which solemnly proclaims, 'The end
  of all things is at hand,' there arises also to the
  well-regulated mind a scene of <span class="pagenum"><a id=
  "page378" name="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span> still greater
  interest&mdash;one more in unison with the soul. There is a kind
  of indescribable sympathy, which, like the sentiment of the
  prophet of Judah, prompts us to wish that our bones may lie by
  the side of our brethren in the sepulchre. This feeling is part
  of our nature, and belongs to that universal link which connects
  and binds man to man, and continues the chain till lost in the
  essence of divinity....</p>

  <p>"What, indeed! can mark a greater alienation of the soul from
  its original nature, than the infidelity which chooses for the
  bed of the grave spots unhallowed by religious associations. They
  who deny their God, and cavil at his Word, can have no reverence
  for places which, like his houses of prayer and the consecrated
  receptacles of the dead, derive all their sanctity and influence
  from a belief in his mercies, and a sense of our
  demerits&mdash;hence, having banished themselves from their
  Father's house, they are content to 'lie down in the grave like
  the beasts that perish.' Whilst, on the contrary, the simply
  virtuous, the sincerely religious, the soberly pious, without
  attaching any value as to the future destination of the soul, to
  the spot in which its earthly sister may crumble to its kindred
  dust, cherish the pleasing hope that their mortal bodies may
  repose in those places alone which religion hallows. They long
  not for pleasure grottos or druidical coppices, in which to be
  gathered to their fathers, but dwelling with chastened hope on
  the glories of the resurrection, they desire their mortal
  particles may be found when the Lord cometh to complete his
  victory over the grave, in the spot, and contiguous to the house
  'in which he has chosen to place his name there.'</p>

  <p>"From the same fountain of ethereal purity, deduced through
  this genuine principle of amiability, is derived that love of
  country which makes his Alps and Avalanches dear to the Swiss,
  and suggested that beautiful image to the Mantuan muse, of the
  Grecian soldier remembering in the last struggles of death his
  pleasant Argos. It is this which makes us revert, with ever
  verdant freshness, to our homes and native places, and binds us
  to the land of our birth with adamantine links. From the burning
  desarts of sunny Africa&mdash;from the wild tornados of the gusty
  West&mdash;from the mountains of ice piled by a thousand ages,
  like impassable barriers round each frozen pole&mdash;from the
  fertile plains and trackless forests of Australia, frequently
  rises, like a breeze of sweetest incense, the fond remembrance of
  our <i>native land</i>; which, even in bosoms scathed by storm
  and pilgrimage, causes to spring up, like a sudden fountain in a
  barren waste, the gushing images of the scenes of home, and all
  their prime deliciousness."</p>

  <p>There are seventy-five pieces in prose and verse, narrative
  and descriptive.&mdash;The price and pretensions would not allow
  costly engravings; and, with the exception of a beautiful
  architectural frontispiece, by Mr. Britton, F.S.A. the
  embellishments are but meagre. This plate is accompanied by a
  brief paper on Christian Architecture, at the close of which Mr.
  Britton says, "The frontispiece has been composed from the
  architectural members of the west front of <i>York Minster</i>;
  and it shows that the monastic artist who designed that
  magnificent facade, gave to it a decided, unequivocal Christian
  character."</p>

  <h2>THE BIJOU</h2>

  <p>Is very properly entitled "An Annual of Literature and <i>the
  Arts</i>," since considerably more attention seems to have been
  paid to the Illustrations than to their accompaniments. Few of
  the prose or verse pieces present much novelty of matter or
  manner; but the following will, perhaps, be esteemed a
  curiosity:&mdash;</p>

  <h3>PORTRAIT OF UGO FOSCOLO.</h3>

  <p>(<i>From the Italian</i>,) <i>by Himself</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A furrow'd brow, intent and deep sunk eyes,</p>

      <p>Fair hair, lean cheeks, are mine, and aspect bold;</p>

      <p>The proud quick lip, where seldom smiles arise,</p>

      <p>Bent head and fine form'd neck, breast rough and cold,</p>

      <p>Limbs well compos'd; simple in dress, yet choice:</p>

      <p>Swift or to move, act, think, or thoughts unfold;</p>

      <p>Temperate, firm, kind, unus'd to flattering lies,</p>

      <p>Adverse to th' world, adverse to me of old.</p>

      <p>Oftimes alone and mournful. Evermore</p>

      <p>Most pensive&mdash;all unmov'd by hope or fear:</p>

      <p>By shame made timid, and by anger brave&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i2">My subtle reason speaks; but, ah! I rave,</p>

      <p>'Twixt vice and virtue, hardly know to steer</p>

      <p>Death may for me have FAME and rest in store.</p>
    </div>

  <p>There is an abundance of Sonnets and short pieces which would
  dovetail in our columns, were we tempted by their merit to
  extract them; but, in place of enumerating them, we notice the
  Engravings, some of which are excellent specimens of art. Among
  these is a Portrait of THE KING, by Ensom, from a painting by Sir
  Thomas Lawrence, in the collection of Sir William Knighton, Bart.
  Next is Ada, a Portrait of a Young Lady, delicately engraved by
  T.A. Dean, after Sir Thomas Lawrence. The print is about the size
  of a crown-piece, a perfect <i>gem&mdash;a <span class=
  "pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379"></a>[pg 379]</span>
  bijou</i> in itself. The African Daughter, by Sangster, from a
  picture by Bonington, abounds with vigorous and effective
  touches; some of the lights are extremely brilliant. Next is the
  Portrait of Mrs. Arbuthnot, by W. Ensom, from the President's
  picture, full of grace and life, and richly meriting the term
  exquisite: nothing can be finer than the dark luxuriant hair
  contrasted with the alabaster delicacy and elegance of the
  features; the eyes too beam with benignant expressiveness.
  Wilkie's Bag-Piper has been powerfully engraved by Aug. Fox; and
  a Portrait of Lady Jane Grey, after De Heere, is an interesting
  variety. Milton composing Paradise Lost, from a drawing by
  Stothard, is far from our taste; but the Blue Bell, by Fox, from
  a picture by W.A. Hastings, somewhat atones for the previous
  failure: its prettiness is of the first class.</p>

  <p>Our notice has extended to all the Engravings except
  one&mdash;Rosalind and Celia&mdash;about which, the less said the
  better. There are, perhaps, too many portraits in the collection,
  but taken apart, they are among the first-rate productions of
  their class.</p>

  <h2>THE FORGET-ME-NOT.</h2>

  <p>Eighty-three pieces in verse and prose are the <i>modicum</i>
  of entertainment in this delightful little work. Of course we
  cannot enumerate a quarter of their titles, but only mention a
  few of the most striking. Among the prose is "A Quarter of an
  Hour too soon," by the author of "The Hour too many," in the last
  Forget-Me-Not. Our favourite story is <i>The Red Man</i>, by the
  Modern Pythagorean of Blackwood, which we quote almost
  entire:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It was at the hour of nine, in an August evening, that a
  solitary horseman arrived at the Black Swan, a country inn, about
  nine miles from the town of Leicester. He was mounted on a large,
  fiery charger, as black as jet, and had behind him a portmanteau
  attached to the croup of his saddle. A black travelling cloak,
  which not only covered his own person, but the greater part of
  his steed, was thrown around him. On his head he wore a
  broad-brimmed hat, with an uncommonly low crown. His legs were
  cased in top-boots, to which were attached spurs of an
  extraordinary length; and in his hands he carried a whip, with a
  thong three yards long, and a handle which might have levelled
  Goliath himself. On arriving at the inn, he calmly dismounted,
  and called upon the ostler by name. 'Frank!' said he, 'take my
  horse to the stable; rub him down thoroughly; and, when he is
  well cooled, step in and let me know.' And, taking hold of his
  portmanteau, he entered the kitchen, followed by the obsequious
  landlord, who had come out a minute before, on hearing of his
  arrival. There were several persons present, engaged in nearly
  the same occupation. At one side of the fire sat the village
  schoolmaster&mdash;a thin, pale, peak-nosed little man, with a
  powdered periwig, terminating behind in a long queue, and an
  expression of self-conceit strongly depicted upon his
  countenance. He was amusing himself with a pipe, from which he
  threw forth volumes of smoke with an air of great satisfaction.
  Opposite to him sat the parson of the parish&mdash;a fat,
  bald-headed personage, dressed in a rusty suit of black, and
  having his shoes adorned with immense silver buckles. Between
  these two characters sat the exciseman, with a pipe in one hand,
  and a tankard in the other. To complete the group, nothing is
  wanting but to mention the landlady, a plump, rosy dame of
  thirty-five, who was seated by the schoolmaster's side,
  apparently listening to some sage remarks which that little
  gentleman was throwing out for her edification. But to return to
  the stranger. No sooner had he entered the kitchen, followed by
  the landlord, than the eyes of the company were directed upon
  him. His hat was so broad in the brim, his spurs were so long,
  his stature so great, and his face so totally hid by the collar
  of his immense black cloak, that he instantly attracted the
  attention of every person present. His voice, when he desired the
  master of the house to help him off with his mantle, was likewise
  so harsh, that they all heard it with sudden curiosity. Nor did
  this abate when the cloak was removed, and his hat laid aside. A
  tall, athletic, red-haired man, of the middle age, was then made
  manifest. He had on a red frock coat, a red vest, and a red
  neckcloth; nay, his gloves were red! What was more extraordinary,
  when the overalls which covered his thighs were unbuttoned, it
  was discovered that his small-clothes were red likewise. 'All
  red!' ejaculated the parson almost involuntarily. 'As you say,
  the gentleman is all red!' added the schoolmaster, with his
  characteristic flippancy. He was checked by a look from the
  landlady. His remark, however, caught the stranger's ear, and he
  turned round upon him with a penetrating glance. The schoolmaster
  tried to smoke it off bravely. It would not do: <span class=
  "pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span> he
  felt the power of that look, and was reduced to almost immediate
  silence.</p>

  <p>"'Now, bring me your boot-jack,' said the horseman. The
  boot-jack was brought, and the boots pulled off. To the
  astonishment of the company, a pair of red stockings were brought
  into view. The landlord shrugged his shoulders, the exciseman did
  the same, the landlady shook her head, the parson exclaimed, 'All
  red!' as before, and the schoolmaster would have repeated it, but
  he had not yet recovered from the rebuke. 'Faith, this is odd!'
  observed the host. 'Rather odd,' said the stranger, seating
  himself between the parson and the exciseman. The landlord was
  confounded, and did not know what to think of the matter. After
  sitting for a few moments, the new-comer requested the host to
  hand him a night-cap, which he would find in his hat. He did so:
  it was a red worsted one; and he put it upon his head. Here the
  exciseman broke silence, by ejaculating, 'Red again!' The
  landlady gave him an admonitory knock on the elbow: it was too
  late. The stranger heard his remark, and regarded him with one of
  those piercing glances for which his fiery eye seemed so
  remarkable. 'All red!' murmured the parson once more. 'Yes,
  Doctor Poundtext, the gentleman, as you say, is all red,'
  re-echoed the schoolmaster, who by this time had recovered his
  self-possession. He would have gone on, but the landlady gave him
  a fresh admonition, by trampling upon his toes; and her husband
  winked in token of silence.</p>

  <p>"As in the case of the exciseman, the warnings were too late.
  'Now, landlord,' said the stranger, after he had been seated a
  minute, 'may I trouble you to get me a pipe and a can of your
  best Burton? But, first of all, open my portmanteau, and give me
  out my slippers.' The host did as he was desired, and produced a
  pair of red morocco slippers. Here an involuntary exclamation
  broke out from the company. It began with the parson, and was
  taken up by the schoolmaster, the exciseman, the landlady, and
  the landlord, in succession. 'More red!' proceeded from every
  lip, with different degrees of loudness. The landlord's was the
  least loud, the schoolmaster's the loudest of all. 'I suppose,
  gentlemen,' said the stranger, 'you were remarking upon my
  slippers.'&mdash;'Eh&mdash;yes! we were just saying that they
  were red,' replied the schoolmaster. 'And pray,' demanded the
  other, as he raised the pipe to his mouth, 'did you never before
  see a pair of red slippers?' This question staggered the
  respondent; he said nothing, but looked to the parson for
  assistance. 'But you are all red,' observed the latter, taking a
  full draught from a foaming tankard which he held in his hand.
  'And you are all black,' said the other, as he withdrew the pipe
  from his mouth, and emitted a copious puff of tobacco smoke. 'The
  hat that covers your numskull is black, your beard is black, your
  coat is black, your vest is black, your small-clothes, your
  stockings, your shoes, all are black. In a word, Doctor
  Poundtext, you are&mdash;&mdash;' 'What am I, sir?' said the
  parson, bursting with rage. 'Ay, what is he, sir?' rejoined the
  schoolmaster. 'He is a black coat,' said the stranger, with a
  contemptuous sneer, 'and you are a pedagogue.' This sentence was
  followed by a profound calm."</p>

  <p>The stranger goes to the stable, and returns.</p>

  <p>"The appearance of the Red Man again acted like a spell on the
  voices of the company. The parson was silent, and by a natural
  consequence his echo, the schoolmaster, was silent also; none of
  the others felt disposed to say any thing. The meeting was like
  an assemblage of quakers. ...</p>

  <p>"'Who can this man be?' 'What does he want here?' 'Where is he
  from, and whither is he bound?' Such were the inquiries which
  occupied every mind. Had the object of their curiosity been a
  brown man, a black man, or even a green man, there would have
  been nothing extraordinary; and he might have entered the inn and
  departed from it as unquestioned as before he came. But to be a
  Red Man! There was in this something so startling that the
  lookers-on were beside themselves with amazement. The first to
  break this strange silence was the parson. 'Sir,' said he, 'we
  have been thinking that you are&mdash;&mdash;' 'That I am a
  conjurer, a French spy, a travelling packman, or something of the
  sort,' observed the stranger. Doctor Poundtext started back on
  his chair, and well he might; for these words, which the Man in
  Red had spoken, were the very ones he himself was about to utter.
  'Who are you, sir?' resumed he, in manifest perturbation; 'what
  is your name?' 'My name,' replied the other, 'is Reid.' 'And
  where, in heaven's name, were you born?' demanded the astonished
  parson. 'I was born on the borders of the Red Sea.'</p>

  <p>"Doctor Poundtext had not another word to say. The
  schoolmaster was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name=
  "page381"></a>[pg 381]</span> equally astounded, and withdrew the
  pipe from his mouth; that of the exciseman dropped to the ground:
  the landlord groaned aloud, and his spouse held up her hands in
  mingled astonishment and awe. After giving them this last piece
  of information, the strange man arose from his seat, broke his
  pipe in pieces, and pitched the fragments into the fire; then,
  throwing his long cloak carelessly over his shoulders, putting
  his hat upon his head, and loading himself with his boots, his
  whip, and his portmanteau, he desired the landlord to show him to
  his bed, and left the kitchen, after smiling sarcastically to its
  inmates, and giving them a familiar and unceremonious nod.</p>

  <p>"His disappearance was the signal for fresh alarm in the minds
  of those left behind. Not a word was said till the return of the
  innkeeper, who in a short time descended from the bedroom
  overhead, to which he had conducted his guest. On re-entering the
  kitchen, he was encountered by a volley of interrogations. The
  parson, the schoolmaster, the exciseman, and his own wife,
  questioned him over and over again. 'Who was the Man in
  Red?&mdash;he must have seen him before&mdash;he must have heard
  of him&mdash;in a word, he must know something about him.' The
  host protested 'that he never beheld the stranger till that hour:
  it was the first time he had made his appearance at the Black
  Swan, and so help him God, it should be the last!' 'Why don't you
  turn him out?' exclaimed the exciseman. 'If you think you are
  able to do it, you are heartily welcome,' replied the landlord;
  'for my part, I have no notion of coming to close quarters with
  the shank of his whip, or his great, red, sledge hammer
  fist.'</p>

  <p>"This was an irresistible argument, and the proposer of
  forcible ejectment said no more upon the subject. At this time
  the party could hear the noise of heavy footsteps above them.
  They were those of the Red Man, and sounded with slow and
  measured tread. They listened for a quarter of an hour longer, in
  expectation that they would cease. There was no pause: the steps
  continued, and seemed to indicate that the person was amusing
  himself by walking up and down the room. It would be impossible
  to describe the multiplicity of feelings which agitated the minds
  of the company. Fear, surprise, anger, and curiosity, ruled them
  by turns and kept them incessantly upon the rack. There was
  something mysterious in the visiter who had just left
  them&mdash;something which they could not fathom&mdash;something
  unaccountable. 'Who could he be?' This was the question that each
  put to the other, but no one could give any thing like a rational
  answer. Meanwhile the evening wore on apace, and though the bell
  of the parish church hard by sounded the tenth hour, no one
  seemed inclined to take the hint to depart. Even the parson heard
  it without regard, to such a pitch was his curiosity excited.
  About this time also the sky, which had hitherto been tolerably
  clear, began to be overclouded. Distant peals of thunder were
  heard; and thick sultry drops of rain pattered at intervals
  against the casement of the inn: every thing seemed to indicate a
  tempestuous evening. But the storm which threatened to rage
  without was unnoticed.&mdash;Though the drops fell heavily;
  though gleams of lightning flashed by, followed by the report of
  distant thunder, and the winds began to hiss and whistle among
  the trees of the neighbouring cemetery, yet all these external
  signs of elementary tumult were as nothing to the deep, solemn
  footsteps of the Red Man. There seemed to be no end to his
  walking. An hour had he paced up and down the chamber without the
  least interval of repose, and he was still engaged in this
  occupation as at first. In this there was something incredibly
  mysterious; and the party below, notwithstanding their numbers,
  felt a vague and indescribable dread beginning to creep over
  them. The more they reflected upon the character of the stranger,
  the more unnatural did it appear. The redness of his hair and
  complexion, and, still more the fiery hue of his garment, struck
  them with astonishment. But this was little to the freezing and
  benumbing glance of his eye, the strange tones of his voice, and
  his miraculous birth on the borders of the Red Sea.</p>

  <p>"There was now no longer any smoking in the kitchen. The
  subjects which occupied their minds were of too engrossing a
  nature to be treated with levity; and they drew their chairs
  closer, with a sort of irresistible and instinctive attraction.
  While these things were going on, the bandy-legged ostler
  entered, in manifest alarm. He came to inform his master that the
  stranger's horse had gone mad, and was kicking and tearing at
  every thing around, as if he would break his manger in pieces.
  Here a loud neighing and rushing were heard in the stable. 'Ay,
  there he goes,' continued he, 'I believe the devil is in the
  beast, if he is not the old enemy himself. Ods, master, if you
  saw his eyes! they are like&mdash;' 'What are they <span class=
  "pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>[pg 382]</span>
  like?' demanded the landlord. 'Ay, what are they like?' exclaimed
  the rest with equal impatience. 'Ods, if they a'n't like burning
  coals!' ejaculated the ostler, trembling from head to foot, and
  sqeezing himself in among the others, on a chair which stood hard
  by. His information threw fresh alarm over the company, and they
  were more agitated and confused than ever.</p>

  <p>"During the whole of this time the sound of walking over-head
  never ceased for one moment. The heavy tread was unabated: there
  was not the least interval of repose, nor could a pendulum have
  been more regular in its motions. Had there been any relaxation,
  any pause, any increase or any diminution of rapidity in the
  footsteps, they would have been endurable; but there was no such
  thing; the same deadening monotonous, stupifying sound continued,
  like clock-work, to operate incessantly above their heads. Nor
  was there any abatement of the storm without; the wind blowing
  among the trees of the cemetery in a sepulchral moan; the rain
  beating against the panes of glass with the impetuous loudness of
  hail; and lightning and thunder flashing and pealing at brief
  intervals through the murky firmament. The noise of the elements
  was indeed frightful; and it was heightened by the voice of the
  sable steed, like that of a spirit of darkness; but the whole, as
  we have just hinted, was as nothing to the deep, solemn,
  mysterious treading of the Red Man."</p>

  <p>The party argue themselves into the belief that he is indeed
  the enemy of mankind.</p>

  <p>"'If more proof is wanting,' resumed the parson, after a
  pause, 'only look to his dress. What Christian would think of
  travelling about the country in red? It is a type of the
  hell-fire from which he is sprung.' 'Did you observe his hair
  hanging down his back like a bunch of carrots?' asked the
  exciseman. 'Such a diabolical glance in his eye!' said the
  schoolmaster. 'Such a voice!' added the landlord: 'it is like the
  sound of a cracked clarionet.' 'His feet are not cloven,'
  observed the landlady. 'No matter,' exclaimed the landlord, 'the
  devil, when he chooses, can have as good legs as his neighbours.'
  'Better than some of them,' quoth the lady, looking peevishly at
  the lower limbs of her husband. Meanwhile the incessant treading
  continued unabated, although two long hours had passed since its
  commencement. There was not the slightest cessation to the sound,
  while out of doors the storm raged with violence, and in the
  midst of it the hideous neighing and stamping of the black horse
  were heard with pre-eminent loudness. At this time the fire of
  the kitchen began to burn low; the sparkling blaze was gone, and
  in its stead nothing but a dead red lustre emanated from the
  grate. One candle had just expired, having burned down to the
  socket; of the one which remained, the unsnuffed wick was nearly
  three inches in length, black and crooked at the point, and
  standing like a ruined tower amid an envelopement of sickly
  yellow flame; while around the fire's equally decaying lustre sat
  the frightened <i>coterie</i>, narrowing their circle as its
  brilliancy faded away, and eyeing each other like apparitions
  amidst the increasing gloom.</p>

  <p>"At this time the clock of the steeple struck the hour of
  midnight, and the tread of the stranger suddenly ceased. There
  was a pause for some minutes&mdash;afterwards a
  rustling&mdash;then a noise as of something drawn along the floor
  of his room. In a moment thereafter his door opened; then it shut
  with violence, and heavy footsteps were heard trampling down the
  stair. The inmates of the kitchen shook with alarm as the tread
  came nearer. They expected every moment to behold the Red Man
  enter, and stand before them in his native character. The
  landlady fainted outright: the exciseman followed her example:
  the landlord gasped in an agony of terror: and the schoolmaster
  uttered a pious ejaculation for the behoof of his soul. Dr.
  Poundtext was the only one who preserved any degree of composure.
  He managed, in a trembling voice, to call out 'Avaunt, Satan! I
  exorcise thee from hence to the bottom of the Red Sea!' 'I am
  going, as fast as I can,' said the stranger, as he passed the
  kitchen-door on his way to the open air. His voice aroused the
  whole conclave from their stupor. They started up, and by a
  simultaneous effort rushed to the window. There they beheld the
  tall figure of a man, enveloped in a black cloak, walking across
  the yard on his way to the stable. He had on a broad-brimmed,
  low-crowned hat, top-boots, with enormous spurs, and carried a
  gigantic whip in one hand, and a portmanteau in the other. He
  entered the stable, remained there about three minutes, and came
  out leading forth his fiery steed thoroughly accoutred. In the
  twinkling of an eye he got upon his back, waved his hand to the
  company, who were surveying him through the window, and clapping
  spurs to his charger, galloped off furiously, with a <span class=
  "pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383"></a>[pg 383]</span>
  hideous and unnatural laugh, through the midst of the storm.</p>

  <p>"On going up stairs to the room which the devil had honoured
  with his presence, the landlord found that his infernal majesty
  had helped himself to every thing he could lay his hands upon,
  having broken into his desk and carried off twenty-five guineas
  of king's money, a ten pound Bank of England note, and sundry
  articles, such as seals, snuff-boxes, &amp;c. Since that time he
  has not been seen in these quarters, and if he should, he will do
  well to beware of Doctor Poundtext, who is a civil magistrate as
  well as a minister, and who, instead of exorcising him to the
  bottom of the Red Sea, may perhaps exorcise him to the interior
  of Leicester gaol, to await his trial before the judges of the
  midland circuit."</p>

  <p>Next is the Omen, by Mr. Galt, a powerful sketch. Affixed to
  St. Feinah's Tree, a Legend of Loch Neagh, we notice the
  signature of an esteemed correspondent, (M.L.B.) whose taste and
  ingenuity entitle her to high rank among the contributors to the
  present work. Kemp, the Bandit, by Delta, is an interesting tale;
  Life and Shade, a Portuguese Sketch, by Mrs. M. Baillie, is in
  her best narrative style; and Seeking the Houdy, by the Ettrick
  Shepherd, is in his happiest familiar vein. The curiosity of the
  volume, and indeed, the only poetical contribution we have room
  to notice, is the following lines of Lord Byron, written in his
  boyhood, to "Mary," (Mrs. Musters,) about a year before her
  marriage:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Editor has subjoined a note, explaining his reason for
  printing these "schoolboy rhymes," which, of course, is not for
  their literary merit; still, in comparison with many of Lord
  Byron's after productions, what the present want of head, others
  lack of heart, and this is a home truth which his warmest
  admirers must acknowledge.</p>

  <p>The Illustrations are varied and interesting. One of
  them&mdash;the Death of the Dove, engraved by W. Finden, from a
  picture by T. Stewardson, is remarkably expressive. The Ghaut, by
  E. Finden, after W. Daniell, is an exquisite Oriental scene. The
  Frontispiece, Wilkie's Spanish Princess, is finely engraved by R.
  Greaves; and Mr. H. Le Keux has done ample justice to the
  Pl&acirc;ce de Jeanne d'Arc, Rouen, from a picturesque drawing,
  by S. Prout: the lights and shadows being very effectively
  managed. But we must be chary of our room, as we have other
  claimants at hand.</p>

  <h2>THE JUVENILE FORGET-ME-NOT.</h2>

  <p>This little work is a sort of <i>proteg&eacute;</i> of <i>The
  Forget-Me-Not</i>, and is by the same editor. It contains fifty
  pieces in verse and prose, and eight pleasing plates and a
  vignette&mdash;all which will please the little folks more than
  our description of them would their elders. Nearly all of them
  contain several figures, but one&mdash;The Riding
  School&mdash;about twenty boys <i>playing at Soldiers</i>, horse
  and foot, very pleasantly illustrates an observation in a recent
  number of the Edinburgh Review, on the dramatic character of the
  amusements of children. The scene is a large, ancient,
  dilapidated building, and the little people personate the Duke of
  Wellington, the Marquess of Anglesea, &amp;c., with all the
  precision of military tactics&mdash;but no one has a taste for
  being a private. So it is through life.</p>

  <p>Our extract is almost a literary curiosity:</p>

  <h3>"THE INVALID'S PIPE.<a id="footnotetag2" name=
  "footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></h3>

  <p>"It was not far from the Castle of F&uuml;rstenstein, near the
  spot where the gallant Blucher, with the brave army of Silesia,
  won such glory, that the Baron of F&uuml;rstenstein met a maimed
  soldier, who was endeavouring to reach Berlin to claim his
  pension, and whose age denoted that his wounds had long been his
  honourable though painful companions. The Baron, observing a very
  richly mounted pipe in the old man's possession, accosted him
  with, 'God bless you, old soldier! does your pipe comfort you
  this morning?' The pipe which the old soldier was smoking was
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>[pg
  384]</span> made of a curious sort of porcelain, and mounted with
  gold. The Baron wondered to see so costly a pipe in the old
  soldier's possession, and wishing to purchase it from him, said,
  'My friend! what shall I give you for your pipe?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, sir!' replied the soldier, shaking his head, 'this pipe
  I can never part with; it was the gift of the bravest of men, who
  took it from a Turkish Bashaw at the battle of Belgrade. There,
  sir, thanks to Prince Eugene, we obtained noble
  spoils&mdash;there, where our troops so bravely destroyed the
  Turkish squadrons.'</p>

  <p>"'Talk another time of your exploits, my friend,' said the
  nobleman; 'here take this double ducat, and give me your pipe; I
  feel an insurmountable wish to possess it.'</p>

  <p>"'I am a poor man, sir, and have nothing to live upon but my
  pension; yet I would not part with this pipe for all the gold
  that you possess. Listen, sir, and I will relate to you the story
  of this pipe, which is remarkable, or my poverty would long ere
  now have induced me to sell it:&mdash;As we Hussars were charging
  over the enemy, a shot from the ranks of the Janissaries pierced
  our noble captain through the breast; I caught him in my arms,
  placed him on my horse, and carried him out of the confusion of
  the battle. It was an irresistible sensation of gratitude that
  prompted me to do so, for he had once rescued me when I was
  wounded and taken prisoner. I watched over him to the latest
  moment; and a few moments before his death, he gave me his purse
  and this pipe, then pressed my hand and breathed his last sigh.
  Heroic spirit! never shall I forget him!'</p>

  <p>"As he thus spoke, the tears fell fast from the old man's
  eyes; but he soon recovered himself, and proceeded&mdash;'The
  money I gave to the worthy landlord under whose roof he died, and
  who had been thrice plundered by the enemy; the pipe I kept as a
  sacred remembrance of the brave. In every situation, and through
  all the vicissitudes of my life, I have taken care to preserve it
  as a sacred relic, whether pursuing or retreating from the enemy;
  and when it was not in use, I placed it for safety withing my
  boot. At the battle of Prague, a cannon-ball unfortunately
  carried my right leg and pipe away together. My first thought was
  to secure the safety of my pipe, for at the moment I felt but
  little pain, and then&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Stop, soldier; your story is too affecting! O tell me, I
  entreat you, who was the brave man, that I may also honour and
  respect his memory?'</p>

  <p>"'His name was Walter von F&uuml;rstenstein; and I have heard
  that his family was of Silesia, and that his estates lay in that
  province.'</p>

  <p>"'Gracious God!' ejaculated the nobleman, 'he was my father!
  and the estates you mention, good old man, are now mine. Come,
  friend, forget all your sorrows, and live with me under that same
  Walter's roof whom you so faithfully served; and come and eat of
  Walter's bread, and partake of that comfort which your age
  demands, and which my gratitude for your services to the best of
  fathers is ready to bestow. I am too deeply affected to say more
  at present; enter this mansion, where you shall repose in peace
  for the remainder of your life!'</p>

  <p>"'Thanks, noble sir, I accept your generous charity; the son
  of Walter von F&uuml;rstenstein is worthy of such a father. Here,
  sir, take this relic (presenting the pipe)&mdash;it is a memorial
  of that Providence which has so miraculously conducted me from
  the father to the son.'</p>

  <p>"The pipe still remains hung up among the family trophies in
  the Castle of F&uuml;rstenstein."</p>

  <h2>THE IRIS.</h2>

  <p>The reader may perhaps require to be told that this work is "a
  Literary and Religious Offering," or Annual. It has been
  tastefully and judiciously edited by the Rev. F. Dale, M.A., and
  its <i>characterestics</i>, if we may use the term, are several
  productions of his highly imaginative and powerful pen. These
  accompany, or rather are accompanied by a series of Engravings
  from pictures, by old masters, on the subject of the Life of our
  Saviour. The other pieces, upwards of forty in number, blend the
  grave with the gayer or lighter subjects.</p>

  <p>Among the embellishments are the Madonna and Child, from
  Murillo; half-figure of the Saviour, and St. John, and St.
  Magdalen, all from Carlo Dolci; The flight into Egypt, from
  Claude; Christ expounding the Law, from Leonardo da Vinci; the
  Incredulity of St. Thomas, from L. Caracci; Hagar and Ishmael,
  from Barocci. The idea of transferring the pictures of the old
  masters to the present work in place of original designs, is
  excellent, and the style in which this arduous task has been
  executed, is creditable to the talents of the respective
  artists.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
